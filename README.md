## Context

In 2018, I knew nothing about computer development and started [a training course to learn web developer](https://openclassrooms.com/fr/paths/48-developpeur-web-junior). There were several projects to hand in and defend in front of a jury. It was one of them.


## Project

The project consists in developing a blog for a writer who wants to publish his new novel episode by episode online.

My very first "complete" IT project with a frontend, a backend and a database.


 ### Instructions

- Development of a blog application in PHP with a MYSQL database. The application must include all [CRUD](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/CRUD) elements : creating chapters, reading chapters, updating chapters and deleting chapters.
- Each chapter must allow comments to be added, which can then be moderated in the administration interface.
- Readers should be able to "flag" comments. They will be marked as "flagged" in the administration interface for easier moderation.
- The administration interface is password-protected.
- Chapters will be written in a [WYSIWYG](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/What_you_see_is_what_you_get) interface based on [TinyMCE](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/TinyMCE).
- Development in PHP without using a framework.
